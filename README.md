##Â Infra

To create infra using CloudFormation first create a ``.env``

And in it define the stack name, for example:

```
export CF_STACK_NAME=PeraPeraStack
```

Then source it with

```
source .env
```

You might also want to set the region. For example

```
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-northeast-1
```
